<!--pargraphs are an example of block elements becuse, by default, they take up the entire width of the web page and add space at the top
and wottom of the elments-->
    <p>this web page shows the difference between block and inline elements</p>

    <!--anchors are an explae of inline element because, by default,they only take up what they need to.
    
    we showed the difference between block and linline elements using developer tools,which we accessed using ctrl+
    shift+i. developer tools is helpful to show you the exact code that is used to display a specific element and
    can show you the width height, and spaceing around an element-->

    <!-- this is an example of an image tag.
    the src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
    the src attribut can be an intrtnet location (i.e.,http:/www.google.com/...),
    but the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the 
    images you use on your website.

     NOTE:img ia a self-closing tag.
