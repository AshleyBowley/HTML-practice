        the form tag is used to creat a container where all the inputs for a form must be put inside
        the attributes that are required are name, id and method

        name gives some descriptive in formation about what the from will be used for.
    
        id allows us to refence this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our code.
    
       method has two typical values:get and post get is used for forms that do not ask for personal information (search bars, etc.)
       post is used for forms that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.)>

        this is a text input. type="text",name, and id are all required attributes.the required
        attribute is only necessary when you want to make sure the user has to fill in input before submitting the form
    
        the type attribute defines the type of input.
        the name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the
        input when the data gets passed to the server (requires back-end scripting,
        which is beyond the scope of this course).
    
        all inputs need a lable with the for attribute that links the lable to the 
        input using the inputs id attribute.
        when an input is required, it is important to include the word required in the labels text.
